# 283. Move Zeroes

###### Easy

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

<b>Note</b> that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

#### Example 1:

<b>Input:</b> nums = [0,1,0,3,12]

<b>Output:</b> [1,3,12,0,0]

#### Example 2:

<b>Input: </b> nums = [0]

<b>Output:</b> [0]
 

#### Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 104
* -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
 

<b>Follow up:</b> Could you minimize the total number of operations done?
